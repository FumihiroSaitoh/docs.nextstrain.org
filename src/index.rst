======================================
Welcome to Nextstrain's documentation!
======================================

Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data.
We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful analyses and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread.
Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response.
If you have any questions, or simply want to say hi, please give us a shout at hello@nextstrain.org.

This documentation is structured to meet the needs of the following user personas\ :sub:`1, 2`\ :
* Bioinformatician
* Researcher
* Public Health Professional
* Nextstrain Reader (General)
* Nextstrain Reader (Scienctific)
* Software developer
* GISAID User
Detailed descriptions of our user personas are here (insert link)

This documentation is comprised of four different types of documents\ :sub:`3`\ :
* Tutorials
* How-to guides
* Reference guides
* Explanations (also known as Discussions)

Let’s get started; what is your goal?
=====================================

* I would like to know what I am looking at on nextstrain.org!
* I am ready to investigate live datasets (including those contributed by the community)!
* I would like to use Nextstrain to process and visualize my own data!
* I have a research question or would like to solve a problem and suspect Nextstrain might be a part of the solution, but I’m not sure how!
* I have submitted sequences to GISAID and want to see if they’ve been included in a Nextstrain-maintained build!
* I would like a general explanation of what Nextstrain is!
* I would like to contribute to Nextstrain!
