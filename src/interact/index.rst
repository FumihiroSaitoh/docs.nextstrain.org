Interacting with Nextstrain
=======================================================================================

Nextstrain.org includes various interactive visualizations, which help with honing in on the genomic data you are after.

.. note:: If you find yourself wondering about how to interpret the visualizations in Nextstrain, `check out the Interpreting Nextstrain section <../interpretation/index.html>`__

Here is a general guide to interacting with these visualizations:

* :doc:`interact`
If you'd like to download data from a dataset on nextstrain.org:

* :doc:`download`
We use slideshows, called "narratives", which include datasets to tell a story in a linear fashion about genomic data. For an introduction to the "narratives", try scrolling through this one:

https://nextstrain.org/narratives/intro-to-narratives

When you're ready to start interacting with live dataset (including those contributed by the community), head over to `nextstrain.org <https://nextstrain.org/>`__ to begin!

If you would like to build and visualize your own dataset using Nextstrain, check out `Using Nextstrain to process and visualize your data <../run_nextstrain/index.html>`__
