Interacting with Nextstrain
=======================================================================================

Nextstrain.org includes various interactive visualizations, which help with honing in on the genomic data you are after.

.. note:: If you find yourself wondering about how to interpret the visualizations in Nextstrain, `check out the Interpreting Nextstrain section <../interpretation/index.html>`__

Here is a general guide to interacting with these visualizations:
